for the most part, Casey loved her little bungalow. it was the perfect size for her, and walking distance from the train, a small locally owned supermarket, and a great Mom & Pop breakfast diner.the only problem was that a string of previous tenants had left their mark in the DIY projects of dubious quality. and the buckets of mail they still received at Casey's address. End.
